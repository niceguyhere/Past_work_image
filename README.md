# Past_work_image
&emsp;&emsp;These are some photos I took when I was working as a medical device technician in the past 10 years in CHINA. Many times, I didnâ€™t take photos, and these photos may only account for 1% of the actual work.
<br/>&emsp;&emsp;Many years of experience in large medical institutions have enabled me to master the maintenance of dozens of common medical devices, including chip-level maintenance. And have a systematic understanding of the internal structure and principles of dozens of medical devices.I can also expertly repair large-scale radiation medical equipment. In terms of medical equipment measurement and testing, I am also very familiar with the verification methods and system theories of various medical devices, and am familiar with the operation of various advanced medical equipment testing and analysis instruments.
<br/>&emsp;&emsp;You can find the photos in the relevant folder.
